## üîë Key Features  
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
   - Comprehensive handling of missing data, outliers, and feature transformations.  
   - Dataset includes attributes such as job designation, resource allocation, mental fatigue score, company type, WFH setup, and gender.  

- **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Implementation of Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (Linear and RBF Kernels), and Random Forest Regressor for predictive analysis.  
   - Model performance evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared Score.  

- **Actionable Insights**  
   - Highlights critical factors contributing to employee burnout.  
   - Offers data-driven recommendations for HR teams to design targeted intervention programs.  

- **Visualization**  
   - Interactive and static visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and correlations.
